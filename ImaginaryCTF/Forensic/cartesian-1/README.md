## Description

THIS IS AN OSINT CHALLENGE.

Greetings. You have been tasked with investigating the whereabouts of a potential recruit. To perform this top-secret background check, we must gather as much information as possible.

Please investigate Terrence Descartes. We know that his social accounts are relatively new, so please do not attack anything out of scope. For the sake of this series of challenges, nothing pertaining to Terry has existed before July 17, 2024. Do not investigate anything posted online before then.

# Solution

When finding a person in OSINT challenges, firstly we could do is find their name in Social Medias. Here, I find `Terrence Descartes`'s account on instagram.
